Hey, don't merge that. I think it's not working
i'm glad you made it
too late
what's the problem?
kanbot isn't very talkative
think it needs an upgrade
he's just shy
talks JSON I guess
assume it's because i'm rather intimidating
means and so that predicate will never pass
oops
fix incoming, or want me to do that?
I'll let you test and send a pull req if that's ok
don't mind the dev branch being broken until then
that would be a good feature to add
i'll look into adding that.
great
I'll look to do a release soon
to test a few of my recent refactoring too
